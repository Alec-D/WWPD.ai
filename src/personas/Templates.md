Create a general prompt template that works with the Mistral AI Instruct model and meets the following requirements:

1. The prompt template takes a string parameter named {prompt} and an array of three user personas named {persona}.
2. The parameter named {prompt} is used to generate a discussion among three users where each user has a unique view about the {prompt} based on their given {persona[index]}.
3. The discussion should maintain a focus on the given {prompt} and ways to resolve the given request in the {prompt} object parameter.
4. These discussions between the users {persona[index]} should produce the best solution to the {prompt}.
5. Include suggestions not mentioned in the first four requirements that should be part of the general prompt template.

Here is a template that meets the requirements:

```js
Discuss the following prompt among five users, each with a unique perspective based on their given persona:

Prompt: {prompt}

User 1 (Persona: {persona[0]}): - Introduction and initial thoughts on the prompt - Ways the prompt can be approached from their unique perspective - Suggestions for solutions based on their persona

User 2 (Persona: {persona[1]}): - Introduction and initial thoughts on the prompt - Ways the prompt can be approached from their unique perspective - Suggestions for solutions based on their persona

User 3 (Persona: {persona[index]}): - Introduction and initial thoughts on the prompt - Ways the prompt can be approached from their unique perspective - Suggestions for solutions based on their persona


# FROM CO-PILOT given a similar request

// Define the personas
const personas = [
  { name: 'Agent 1', personality: 'analytical' },
  { name: 'Agent 2', personality: 'creative' },
  { name: 'Agent 3', personality: 'practical' },
  // Add more agents as needed
];

// Function to start a conversation
function startConversation(prompt, personas) {
  // Initialize the conversation with the prompt
  let conversation = `User: ${prompt}\n`;

  // Loop through the personas and have each one respond to the prompt
  personas.forEach((persona, index) => {
    // Generate a response based on the persona's personality
    let response = generateResponse(prompt, persona);

    // Add the response to the conversation
    conversation += `${persona.name} (${persona.personality}): ${response}\n`;
  });

  // Return the conversation
  return conversation;
}

// Function to generate a response based on a persona's personality
function generateResponse(prompt, persona) {
  // This is where you would implement the logic to generate a response
  // based on the persona's personality and the prompt. For now, this is a placeholder.
  return `I'm ${persona.name} and I'm ${persona.personality}. Here's my response to "${prompt}"...`;
}

// Example usage
console.log(startConversation('How can we solve climate change?', personas));
```
